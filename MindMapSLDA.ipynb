        "1. Cost-Effectiveness\n",

        "2. Scalability:\n",
        "\n",
        "    This approach allows for easy scalability. As the volume of data grows, more inexpensive hardware devices can be added to the cluster to handle the increased workload.\n",
        "3. Fault Tolerance:\n",
        "\n",
        "    With a distributed setup of inexpensive hardware, the system becomes inherently fault-tolerant. If one machine fails, the impact on the overall system is minimal as the workload can be distributed across other functioning nodes.\n",

        "    Standard hardware devices offer flexibility in terms of vendor choices and configurations. Organizations can choose hardware based on their specific requirements and budget constraints.\n",
        "5. Parallel Processing:\n",

        "1. Management Complexity:\n",

        "    Managing a cluster of numerous inexpensive hardware devices can be complex. It requires expertise in cluster management, configuration, monitoring, and maintenance.\n",
        "2. Higher Failure Rate:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Inexpensive hardware devices may have a higher failure rate compared to high-performance machines. This increases the likelihood of hardware failures within the cluster, necessitating robust fault-tolerance mechanisms.\n",
        "3. Performance Variability:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Standard hardware devices may exhibit variability in performance due to differences in specifications, configurations, and quality. Ensuring consistent performance across all nodes in the cluster can be challenging.\n",
        "4. Limited Resources per Node:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Inexpensive hardware devices typically have lower computational power, memory, and storage capacities compared to high-performance machines. This limitation may restrict the types of Big Data processing tasks that can be efficiently performed on individual nodes.\n",
        "5. Network Bottlenecks:\n",

        "2. Performance: This model offers the highest performance since there is no overhead for ensuring delivery. Messages are sent and processed without any additional checks or guarantees.\n",
        "3. State Requirements: Minimal state is required to implement this model. Since there are no guarantees of delivery, the system does not need to maintain extensive state information about message delivery.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Reliability: In this model, messages are guaranteed to be delivered at least once. This means that messages may be duplicated, but they will not be lost. Retransmissions ensure that even if a message is lost, it will eventually be delivered.\n",
        "2. Performance: The performance of this model is slightly lower compared to best effort delivery because of the additional overhead of tracking message delivery and handling duplicates.\n",
        "3. State Requirements: Moderate state is required to implement this model. The system needs to keep track of sent messages and possibly acknowledgments to ensure that messages are not lost and are not delivered multiple times.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Reliability: In the exactly once delivery model, each message is guaranteed to be delivered exactly once. There are no duplicates, and no messages are lost. This is achieved through careful coordination between sender and receiver, often involving acknowledgments and transactional mechanisms.\n",
        "2. Performance: This model typically has the highest overhead and the lowest performance due to the complexity of ensuring exactly once delivery. The additional checks and coordination required can impact throughput and latency.\n",
        "3. State Requirements: Significant state is required to implement this model. The system needs to maintain detailed information about message delivery, acknowledgments, and potentially rollback mechanisms in case of failures. This can increase the complexity and resource requirements of the system."

        "4. Query engines like Apache Hive, Apache Impala, or custom-built APIs are used to query and analyze the data stored in the serving layer.\n",
